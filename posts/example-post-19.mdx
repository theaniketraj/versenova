How come we never 


Talked with each other 


Even though 


In my mind 


I was your lover 


How come we never 


Felt something strange 


When our individual lives 


Was breaking over 


I think 


My mind denied 


My heartâ€™s thought 


And I followed 


How come we never 


Touched each other 


Only meeting to


Exchange goodbyes 


I loved you 


Even If I say no 


But 


How come we never 


Loved each other 


Even with the bond 


Between us 


How come we never 


Fixed each other 


Even if you've always been


My best well wisher
