I used to think a lot 


What I am gonna be 


When I grow up 


Now that I am 


I'm confused 


I should choose to be good 


Or 


Chosen fate is there for me 


Should I be kind


Or 


Make my way going rough 


Doing anything wrong 


And pretending I'm naive 


If people gets to chose 


their life 


Why so much chaos all around
