Someone said they hate their life


A lot say they agree with the guy


Imma thinking about the time


When I was on a downward line


No where to gather courage from


Besides Holding up my hopes strong


Someone told they ain't happy mingle


Many told they do agree


Imma thinking about my life


How I spent it totally alone


Maybe waiting was all written for me


Somebody said they don't sin


Fearing a place in hell


But they did complain of someone else's


Way of sinning being different from them
