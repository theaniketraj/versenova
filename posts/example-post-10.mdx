Oh my love


I'll wait for you


Down the hallway


After the midnight


Before the Dawn


As I've waited for so long


Be there on time


Or a day again


Will pass by


Sun will shine again


Birds will chirp again


But what bout my heart


Might it stop beating


In Longing for meeting


So while I stay


I hope you come


Before comes another day
