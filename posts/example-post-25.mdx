Woke up at midnight


With your thoughts in mind


Almost remembered the dream


I saw about you and me


You were so close in my dreams


Never been so in my life


The dream was so real


I refuse to believe that it


Was just a dream


Miss you so badly


But it's worse that


I can't say how I feel to you


Wish I could get a chance


To see you everyday


Wish you were my neighbor


I could throw a party


I could get excuse to invite you


Seeing you daily would be a ritual for me


& I would follow it religiously
