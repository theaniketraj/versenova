Fuck that feeling

On which I'm stuck

Since I saw you

It won't make me

Move forward

Made me heartless

Since I gave you

Mine heart

No space for others

You occupied all

Can't forget your face

And that innocent gaze

Which never fades

Cause I keep it refreshed

Damn

I've wired my brain

To keep missing you
