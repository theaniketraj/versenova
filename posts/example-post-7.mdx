It's new year


& you're not here


I dream of places


Walking hand in hand


I think of our bond


Going bold over phases


Life's pretty hard pretty


We gonna deal it with all together


Yet here my hands wait


For holding you bare


It's that time of the year


And yet you're not here


How I hold breath


For you to find me in mist of air


My peace lies in your tranquility


My silence holds my patience


Or we'd by in our arms long forever


I hope roman empire of mine in you


Conquer the world and live free


For it where would be peace


If not in lying next to you
