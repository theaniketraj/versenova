Following you 


Made me realise 


I won't get you 


So easily 


Why don't I 


Try it harshly 


Cause I don't 


Wanna let you go 


Whatever it takes 


I'm ready to go through 


Cause in my head 


You're already mine 


Cause in my heart 


I'm already yours 


I accept that 


I'm novice 


in matters of heart 


But I realise


I won't get you 


So easily 


Why don't I 


Try it harshly 


Cause I don't 


Wanna let you go
