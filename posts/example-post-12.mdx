I'm dreaming of you again


I'm falling for you again


Stop me dear God 


Or are you helping me again


Oh it's your eyes duh


Can't take mine off


Those cute freckles duh


Reddish as they turn on me


My nights be wilding again


As I wait for the sun to take over


So we'd meet and be together


If you plan on falling let it be my arms


If you plan on stealing let it be my heart
