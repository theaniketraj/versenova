I think she's so me

In all the way the world she sees

She's just the younger version of me

In the way she giggles

And keeps her mind free

All the path she chooses

Are the once crossed by me

As I used to do when I was young

She gets in sunlight

And claims the glow

I think she is so me

She chooses her own sadness

And still wants to remain free

Of all the younger versions of me

She's the one who was most carefree

She's younger than

I'll ever be
