You knew I loved you


Meeting you was no accident


Fell so fast


In love


Never knew


You'd make me


A thing of past


I confessed


I'm vulnerable


Don't have a good past


Saw a future with you


Thought I would be your last


Never knew


You'd make me


A thing of past


I told you I trust none


Not allowed by my heart


All the way it was cut off


I thought you'd heal it


Maybe even own it
