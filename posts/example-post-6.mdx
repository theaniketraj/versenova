I got a girl


She's from another world
Doesn't fear sinning naked
Would go to hell with me
Says had a empty life before me
And life carries no meaning
But denies that she's nihilist
I wish myself to be like her
Without the pinch of nihilism
We talk about saving humanity
As if we eat leaving no crumbs
She doesn't beg for love
A diffident believer in destiny
Her past carries uncanny resemblance
With that of mine hence I believe
We'd be having the same fate
The same future and the same ending
