```
And in every flaws and curve
Of my own soul
I found traces of you
As if you were meant to
Fold all my creases
Heal my self inflicted pain
Of which I was the cause.
```

<div style="text-align: left">```
Let's keep it simple
I'm not in love with your dimple
Neither in with your eyes
Nor the way you shy
I'm in love with you total
Despite knowing it's fatal 
We won't meet cause of fate
But I think I should tell you my feelings
Before it gets too late.
```</div>
