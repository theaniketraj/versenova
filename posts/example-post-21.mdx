Let's just run away

Far from the world

Where you can speak

Whatever you want

And I can show

Whatever I feel

Just come with me

The world which didn't tolerated

Romantic poets

I'm sure won't allow

Us to together breath

Let's just run away

To a place

Where we love solitude

We just love each other &

Without worrying about any material things
