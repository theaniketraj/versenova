```
Of all the nights
I've missed you in each
Only to end up wishing
You remember me 
Or even a part of me atleast

5. And in every flaws and curve 
Of my own soul
I found traces of you
As if you were meant to 
Fold all my creases 
Heal my self inflicted pain
Of which I was the cause

6. Bitter truth told is always better than false hope promised. 

7. Big trouble in a little tee.

8. She comes unexpectedly 
in my brain
Pausing the nerves
Causing a sprain

9. We are afraid of darkness only because we are addicted to lights.

10. You're so far from eyes yet so close to vision.

11. Never felt in such a way
So strong was your presence
My soul left me for a while
As if you were supposed to be mine
I never wished for a longer life
But I'd love to be yours .......................tbc

12.  I wish to hide you
The way almighty hid pearls in sea
The way eyes hide under eyelashes
Hid in a way no one can see
You in the way I do

13. I still remember days
When I used to pray
Not that I was naive
But I didn't knew
Everyone fades / people eventually fade
Now that I know 
Is it that I grew?
I miss the old me
Or is it just a glow?

14. Look
Loving you got me where
Even my soul left me 
As did you 

15. Only if you could've been mine, what would not have been possible for me.

16. Let's meet once again
Pretending to be a stranger
This time I promise
I'll try my best to 
Hold you forever 
However strong the distance grows

17. God is kind. Perhaps too much. 

18.  An Ideal person is one who has attitude and gratitude in right proportion.

21. I am the master of my fate. I an the captain of my soul.

22. Eyes are not to play, they are to kill.

23. Let's keep it simple
I'm not in love with your dimple
Neither in with your eyes
Nor the way you shy
I'm in love with you total
Despite knowing it's fatal 
We won't meet cause of fate
But I think I should tell you my feelings
Before it gets too late.

24. People will judge 
You gonna smudge
People will fool
You gonna rule. 

25. There is no word found for substitute of love but alternatives of care get viral everyday.

26. #AniketRaj
Painting the life I had imagined
Glad I'm addicted to music, not people
Wanna help me in increasing entropy, text me
♡K bye, come again.

27. I've missed you in each of my night only to wake up with the feeling that I'm gonna do that everyday. 

28. I don't blame you
For moving past me
Time always flickers
I am a slow guy
I don't blame you 
As I didn't believe 
That all signs were True.

29. The thing I used to believe
The thing which made me relieve
Suddenly falling in love with you
Made my incomplete wishes
Come True
Now that I see myself back
Just feel how much I was empty
Doesn't count those years of my age
Which I lived without you.

30. Oh baby
please don't doubt me
Either don't doubt my love
The words often fall short
In explaining you our unbreakable knot
Everyone say I am impatient
But I can wait for you till my last moment
Promise that you won't leave me
Either don't leave my love
Please don't doubt me
Either don't doubt my love

31. I often try to pen you up in Words, not realising English has finite words while my feelings are infinite. 

32. Life is too deep for words, so don't try to describe try to live.

33. Tomorrow I will
Gonna be kill
The pain of past
And let my life Heal
As those day went
When I was
Taking sleeping pills
Just to avoid all
heavy bill
Those days when I 
Had chances to seal the deal
But above all
Tomorrow I will 
Gonna be kill
The pain of past 
And let my life Heal.

34. If only somehow you could've been mine, what would not have been possible for me. 

35. Whenever I see me
I feel I'm half
The other half being
Always with you
You come to my mind
Each new second
Is it only me Missing you?
Or did you felt the pain too?
There was always a reason
I avoided confessing you
Half I feared society 
The other half I feared losing you
You can call me dumb
For loving you silently
But silent people often
End up killing their happiness themselves.......

36. Let's look at the world
That goes without us

37.  If life teaches you the art of falling down,
It's your duty to teach life the art of rising over each time.

38. To be first, you will have to accept the mistakes you did when you were at the last.

39. Everytime I pray
The same I have to say
Why did I made the delay?
You were totally mine
And I let you turn gray

40. I don't regret for bad people in my life.
I regret for the time spent with them.

41. Life is meant for trial and error. 

42. Excuses are easy
Confessions are tough
Love is easy
Delay is rough

43. Denial and negligence are just two perspectives for same injustice. 

44. I often ask myself
After these years
Do you still remember me
Have you forgot  .........

45. I've loved you in every blink
In every breath 
And in every thoughts between the two
As if I hold your hands intertwined
Imagination precedes the distance
Otherwise I would've made you mine

46. I find you in every book I read
I see you in every shades of moon
I hope for you with every breath
I've made a promise with myself
I'll find you and I'll love you. 

47. You're one of the stones 
I saw
Frozen by the lake
Yet so beautiful
Despite being so sad
Hard to grasp
Hardest to forget

48. The shadows 
Which I often find
Myself lost into
Are nothing but 
The remains of our
Intertwined souls

49.  And I know
I won't be able to 
Forget you
Till my last breath 
Since you're etched 
Into every openings
Of my broken heart

50. You're like Feb
I crave so hard for you
But as soon as you arrive 
I start to dread

51. Heart needs silence
Soul needs love
I'm unable to find
Silence between the two

52. Somehow I often fail to 
Convey my feelings
My mind is to blame
For the tangled thoughts 
How would you respond
If I poured out my heart

53. Let's meet once again 
Pretending to be a stranger 
This time I promise 
I'll try my best to 
Hold you forever 
However strong the distance grows.

54. Let's do all the 
Things together
Which leads to hell
For then we'll see
Who holds the other strongest
Cause then only we would
Change hell into heaven

55. Hope our paths get crossed again
Like do trains on pathways
One from each direction
Passengers 

56. You do remember
If we're together 
You gonna find me staring at 
you every morning when 
you wake up admiring you
But I won't say a word
For words often end diluting up
.........

57. But if you never told me you loved me did you ever gave me a place in your heart. ....

58.  How do two people 
Know they're made for each other
Maybe they don't
They just stick together 
to find out so
and a lifetime get passed
With love in between

59. Someone might be 
Waiting for me
Like I am 
& when it happens
I hope it to last an eternity
For what love worth
If not being together 

60. I don't worry about writing whatever comes to my mind because someone somewhere might deduce thousand meaning from two letter thought of mine.

61. Can't wait for the time when everything in my life starts to make sense.

62. A part of me 
Went away with you
When you left
Now all I'm left
Is handful of thoughts
And some memories of you.

63. If we meet again 
I'll make sure
I unfold your heart
And see whether 
Mine fit inside yours
For what is the safest place
If not your heart
To rest my soul

See whether you're still
As you were back then
Or you  ..........................

64. Why do I feel
We'll meet again
As if my soul longs
For a missing part
Being carried by
Your broken heart. 

65. Even if you were 
Meant to break my heart
I'm grateful for your
Presence in my life 
For you calmed 
The chaos in me 
like no one did

66. Me being alone isn't an indication of your absence but rather of my own love for solitude and inclination towards self destruction. 

67. My overthinking leads me nowhere 
But still I love to travel the path.

68. If there was a way of painless death, I'd be dead real long before dying from your memories.

69. If I had to chose between death and you 
I'd choose death
Atleast it would totally be mine. 

70. The world is hell bent on my survival
I am myself responsible for my destruction..

71. If there's a place reserved for you in hell
I will lovingly go against fate to join you. 

72. I believe there was a reason
I didn't had courage to confess you
Either it wasn't in destiny
Or it was against it. 

73. I often try to justify
Of me not telling you my feelings
Despite knowing that there is a
Void in my heart
Never can be filled
It demands your presence
Only your soul scent 
And your 

74. If only somehow you could've been mine,
I would've never been so reliant on poetry to reimburse your absence. 

75.  If you ever get another lover
Make sure he loves you more than me
For only then my manifestation/reverie will fail
Of meeting you again
With intention of a spending lifetime with you 

76.  I'm starved of your touch
As the way are deserts starved of rain
Feelings starved of pain

77. Bury me near you when I die
As I spent all my life buried in your thoughts.

78. She's so beautiful
It'd be no less than magic
To look at her even from far
My eyes start dilating
If we get too close............

79. If ever our love story gets written
Don't know I'll be hero or villain
Hero that let you go 
Villain of my own heart 
Hero in your part

80. And I know
Whoever I'm gonna meet after you
Will only lead me to some poem or thoughts
But will not complete my soul. 

81. You look familiar
As if you take part in my sins
Or bear their punishment on my behalf
Looks like you want me by your side
Otherwise you wouldn't cross my way everyday
Opening up isn't comfort
Holding in is a tragedy
And I'm good at both
I love to decay myself
But I'd love if you'll be at my grave
I'll die with a satisfaction
You were with me even for a moment.

82.  Time really slows down
As you pass by me
Our eyes really get fixated
I've felt both
Heartache seldom reminds me
What would be like in
Your gracious presence

83. Only almighty knows
How hard i try
To fill your void
Only to end up everytime
With empty heart and 
A handful of melancholia

84. If the world were ending tomorrow
I'd prefer to die before you
For I'd be contented that
I spent my last breath in your arms. 

85. They say two hearts never break the same.

86. But what if
I chose to never confess
Contain it in my heart
Drowned in thoughts
& leave the world
Like an unturned book
Would it be fine for you

87. Gradually I'm getting
All these years I never actually
Lived in my home
I just passed time
Patiently waiting to leave
For it was no less than a hell
And no more than a Grave. 

88. I'd love to break my heart in thousand pieces
For each one would bear your name
Screaming from the pain of separation
Cursing gods and angels
Longing to unite us together

89. If there's some sadness in me
And if you're the cause
I'd love to live with it forever
[if its only way we'd live together]  
I believe only
This way we can be together

90. It's miraculously disturbing
How your memories hit me suddenly
Out of nowhere
As if your heart longs For
My forgotten roots
Which were once
A part of yours

91. I really hope we meet again
When our lives are calmed
And our heart is healed......

92. And perhaps you're the reason I was never found again 

93. Lay by my side
Let me explore you
I might find the lost me
In voids of your heart. 

94. Speak of her
Watch my face lit up

95. And everytime I lost myself
I found you
so i always keep losing
in order to keep winning you

96. Often people ask me
Why I don't have any addiction ?
I'm in no mood to tell them
I'm addicted to keep breaking my heart
over and over again
by replaying your memories.

97. If there's a place 
Where we can be alone
By being together
I'd love to wait for you

98. And if I were to kiss you for the last time
I'd love to do it by remaining Drowned in your eyes.

99. Maybe your prayers are the reason
All of my self destruction methods fail drastically

100. And since I was stunned by Your beauty
I chose to remain silent 

And since I found no one like you
I let everyone go

And since no one understood me like you do
I chose to remain unheard 

And since no one calmed my soul like you
I chose to keep burning all my life 

And since no one gave me the warmth of love like you
I chose to be cold blooded all my life 

101. Of all the words you could say
You chose the one which hurt me
Of all the memory you could erase
You chose the one closest to me

102. I've fallen in love with you each new day 

103. You give me a glow
A new kind of flow

104. I kept thinking about writing a song on your beauty when I reach home 
Now here I'm out of words to describe the same.

105. I hope I write a song about you and you understand I love you. 
I don't like to 

106. I don't prefer speaking in places where no one wants to hear me. 

107. The distance between my heart and legs grows each day. Heart keeps getting closer to you, steps I take to keep getting far.

108. I'm guilty of all the sins I didn't do and still repenting for them. 

109. I wait for you as if you've promised to return. 

110. My heart and feet are in constant battle. One keeps getting closer to you, the other I make sure keeps getting far from you. 

111. I hope we meet again
This time I have the courage to confess
And strength to bear if you reject.

112. My heart is tired of being broken by you again and again. 

113. I often think about the day I'll talk to you last time. 
How will be the day following
What changes will I witness in myself
Will I miss you ? Moreover I'll think if you miss me or not
When I'll meet new people whether or not I'll try to find you in them
What if my fear of no one understanding me comes back

114. My love for night grows each day
I can think about you freely
Repent for all the good things I didn't do
Worship the demons in my head
You said you are okay with dying alone
That made me thinking whether you're God
Cause I believe in angels and they beg to differ

115. Since I heard you're not into me
I traverse less from heart to soul
Each one betrayed the other.

116.  You deserve to be eaten out until my appetite is killed forever. 

117. I will never understand how you somehow manage two lovers at the same time
For it would take me to forget the privilege of being a one woman guy.

118. What I fear the most is one day we'll say bye for the last time and not even know it. 

119. I'm guilty of praying for your departure
Since I know missing you will be beautiful than being with you. 

120. Gift me a book. I'll Drown reading it.
Gift me a library I'll ask for your arms to die while reading them all. 

121. I'd have never let you go
But I realise you lead double life
One in my ___________
Other one with a stranger

122. How shameful it is I carry your pain
While you keep sinning behind my back. 

123. How shameful it is I carry your pain

124. I miss you As much as I miss the old me.

125.  I like to die a little every day so that my final death won't feel heavy. 

My final death wasn't so heavy
As I kept dying a little everyday all my life. 

127. What If we have crossed each other
Like a thousand splendid stars
Yet never managed to have
Our attention struck
We just passed on with a glance

128. I stopped living long ago
Now I just pass through time. 

129. I haven't slept peacefully in years.
Lend me your Lap and watch me pass over heaven to get back to you. 

130. The very best I learnt from you is the feeling of waiting for someone since you couldn't do it for me. 

131. There are days when I miss you the most. Others just remind me I've a life too. 

132. There's doubts running in my veins. Sun rising over each time I see you. Never knew what to do with this feeling. Blessed that 

133. You look scarred
Who knows what's hiding behind them
Your own sins Or
Sins of your ancestors
Of which you've become part.

134. I don't fear death thanks to my father's tyranny. 
Make sure to dance at my funeral cause I just lost to something I've no respect for. 

135. Dissect me into as many pieces as you want. 
You'll end up with all the pieces wanting to be with you.

136. I try my best to collect your remnants from wherever you leave. They will be my salvation to peace once you leave. 

137. Since I always wished to be on top of the world
I never became satisfied with anything in life. 

138. The harder I try to shorten distance between us
The easier you find it to get us separated.

139. And if I were to meet you someday again
I'll be apologising first
Since I no longer carry the heart which fell for you. 

140. Life's been real rough Since you left.

141. He who finds his salvation in a person is destined to be alone. 

142. I wonder if you might be Waiting for me
Cause I haven't moved an inch without you. 

143. If you could somehow open the seams of my heart
All you'll see is your own reflections.

144. I'll preserve your memories for afterlife
Maybe I get a chance to relieve them.

145. I never believed in God
Until we met and got separated
Since it made me realise
You're the god I was looking for all my life. 

146. I don't fear dying alone.
I fear getting born empty handed and knowing you've been Waiting for me. 

147. Felt my gods laughing at me
While I was praying for you
How idiotic I must be
To ask you for myself from my gods
While you be finding peace in someone else's arms.

148. Let's kiss for so long
Our lips burn out and
The heat reaches the heart
Enough to create a burning desire
For each other 

149. Now that I know
Why men Have two faces
What should I chose
Being innocent among cruel
Or cruel among dime worth people 

150. I write at midnight when half the world is sleeping. Even if half the world criticise what I write the other half would wake up to praise it.

151. The closer I'm to home
The more homesick I feel
I noticed with the years
The stairs of my home 
Went smaller in size
Even the balcony shrank
It did make me wonder
Nature has a strange way of 
Telling us we are growing
It won't show in ourselves quite clearly
Until we chose to look at someone else
And see if they're withering

152. I think of you so often that my thoughts get tangled but even then you're the only one who comes to the rescue. 

153. I somewhat hate myself. Will you be able to love me ? 

154. You've played with my heart so enough, I don't mind myself being tossed around for your pleasure. 

155. I've loved you a thousand times more every time you said you miss me when I'm not around.

156. I thought of giving up on you but soon I realised it meant to give up on poetry as well.

157. I used to always think about the day we'll talk last time but since you told me about your guy I've started to live as if each day is our last. 

158. I've always seen you As my friend
But a friend for a lifetime
A friend whom I could marry
And still be friend.

159. I can go against every destiny in which you aren't written for me.

160. You broke my heart so elegantly, it refuses to be mine now.

161. All the questions of mine which you ignore have started to create hole in my heart. 

162. I was so delusional to think you're mine
Earth was slipping from my feet
And I was happily carving your dreams
Loving you was never easy
Anyways I kept doing that I was so crazy
I forgot to ask what should I head for before you left 
Because All you left for me was me on my empty self

163. If I'd known beforehand
You're gonna leave me
I would've left the part of me
Which was gonna love you.

164. You seem a goddess to me
But which one I wonder
The one I pray for my soulmate
Or the one who took away her 

165. We shouldn't be talking for few days
I just gave up on you 

We shouldn't be meeting for few days 
I just gave up on you

We shouldn't be sharing anything for few days
I just gave up on you

Few days until I convince myself you were never mine
Few days until I convince myself I was alone all the way
Few days until I convince myself I was delusional
Few days until I convince myself you only talked to me in your free time
Few days until I convince myself you gave me attention when your guy was away

166. I'll never forget the night we met
For I'd always remain in doubt
It was best thing to happen or
Just another lesson for me 

167. I wanted you to be my life but you just became a part of my life and that's fucking ok.

169. I never worried about you forgetting me Cause you never remembered me. 

170. I let you know my secrets only because I wanted you to leave my life. 

171. You have no idea how fast a girl's choice changes.
Be a master of her choices not a slave of her mindset. 

172. And if you consider to leave me, do leave me with full pride and glory so when I die I can boast among gods who I was loved by.

173. She doesn't stare at anyone
Afraid someone might read her soul
She smiles at no one
Afraid they might steal her smile
If that happens all she'll be left with is 
A Void heart with empty smile.

174. How tragic is it that we humans talk the least about the things we feel the most

175. And when the sun would forget it's radiance
When darkness would've encompassed the world
You may find me hiding in a corner
Shielded by Your hope of returning

And when the worldly pleasures have consumed me
Leaving nothing but guiltier body
You may find my soul resting somewhere
Waiting for you to claim what was yours all the way

176. The Less I know, the more knowledgeable I am.
The less I know, the more wisdom I possess. 

177. I've realised I learnt how to let you go in the process of loving you and it was best thing to learn.

178. And now when I think of it
Maybe our friendship blossomed too fast
Into love but you didn't let it ripe
Maybe you've been attracted to other gardeners of yours more than me

179. All I find between you two is lots of love, lot of lust, lot of passion and craze for each other and all  I find myself is between the love, lust, Passion and craze you have for each other.

182. And the essence of soul is lost if it's seen only through eyes.

183. If there's something like afterlife, I don't want it and if there's something like reincarnation I hope I'm the reason behind it. 

184. Suddenly your absence 
Have started to heal me
As if wounds given by you
Was my home &
Now you left me homeless.

186. I'm the sum of all the hurts you've done to me. 

187. Everything I've ever dreamed of
Everything I've ever thought of
Was always in my destiny
I was just failing to learn
Brave are those who inherit the earth. 

188. All the places I've never been
Are all the places I'll never be
All the feelings I've never had
Are all the feelings I'll never have
All the people I've ever seen
Are all the people I'll never be 
All the people I've ever seen
Are all the people I'll never see
All the dreams I've ever dreamt
Are all the dreams I'll never sleep

190. My superpower is reading so I write a lot.

191.  And yet I continue to love you despite of all the upcoming consequences 

192. I saw two lovers walking hand in hand
talking and sharing whatever they thought
Not caring about the passers by

I saw two lovers sitting next to each other
reading books and one another eyes in a library
Not caring about the readers nearby

I saw two lovers munching corns in a theatre
hearing and watching heart beats and movie
Not caring about the watchers nearby

193. Maybe our paths never crossed because our ways were opposite of each other.
Maybe you never waited for me because I was never the right 
Maybe we stopped saying sorry each other because we got fine hurting each other.
Maybe you took another path with someone else because I was never your destination.
Maybe I stopped looking for you because I knew you were gone forever and would never return for me.
Maybe you never thought of me because I was always just an option for you.
Maybe you never thought of me more than a friend because you had someone else for just that.

194. People been telling me How can one see heaven without dying?
I've been dying to asked them if they've ever fell in love and stared into their lovers soul.

195. If ever you get into hell somehow, trust me I'll be there before you fighting gods to be placed next to you.

196. If you ever feel you've sinned too much
Just share them with me
I've been doing it for long now
Carried my father sins all the childhood
then my own sins until I met you
It won't matter carrying yours

197. The girl in my dreams has always been you
The girl in my poems has always been you
The girl in my

198. I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling
Falling for you once again
Falling for you once more
I hope you'd hold me this time

Show me already girl

Falling the hardest I can
Once again for you
Once more in love with you

207. How slowly I've evolved
Made life so tiring for me
I've been sick 

208. It's life. Everyone goes through the same experience. Just the lenses are different. 

209. Baby only you've been in my thoughts
Whenever I'm sad or horny or both
Sometimes romantic or horny or both
But you the only on my mind
No one could ever cross my heart
Like the way you've done
The swiftness with which you
Went down on me

210. I always choose the lazy way and still make it workout everytime.

211. I see shades of you
Every now and then
I don't look for you
I see face of yours
In faces of thousands
I cross by everyday 

212. A girl so fine
Whom I adored and loved in 
My dreams, Imagined a
Different life with her
A girl so fine
Who couldn't be mine 
God, Why I'm so shy?
I can talk to everyone
But why not when it's her time

213. I like my pain
To hurt me
It makes me remember you
It force me to realise
My mistakes
And part of your negligence 

214. I hate the consequences
Which led me to where I am
I love the pathway
Which led me to you
The collision between these two
Where I find you often
Now that you've left me

215. I remain in troubled state
What's for me in my fate
Tired of getting hurt
And constant healing
Despised over this feeling
Makes me think

216. She's so beautiful 
Her beauty
Exemplifies all the
Art in the world 

217. I can feel the heat
Through my hands
As if toxins are 
Passing through my glands 
Never been so alone
In my life before
I'm back to being lone
After so much time 
I'm burning my soul
To keep my heart alive
The way I did
Burnt myself when

• 

218. To have clarity of thoughts you must possess ability to provoke each pixels.

219. What's in a name
It's all a part of game
An act of blame and game
Maybe it's all part of a plan
We all are drops in a can

220. I consume myself
With my thoughts
It's all a cycle
I heal myself 
With my clots
Wish you see me
While I'm in my form

The dying money dilemma 

221. It's that time of the year again
When you'd be Waiting for me
As did a bird for It's partner
Those were the days when
We loved same way the each other
As does velocity to It's time
I'd forever be Waiting as the
Velocity be doing for it's acceleration 
It's that winter from the past again
When snow fell day and night
Billing us more time and much-time inside out
As does Rome does to It's pope
As was suffered by Socrates to It's Classical Athens

222. If you believe that our destiny is written then friendship is the catalyst in it.

223. I've always felt I'm a letter which was to be delivered in 90s but here I'm in 2025.

224. Traditional thoughts doesn't breed modern innovations.

225. Those who think they understand me are a mere fraction of my belief system. 

226. I think of you 99% of the time. I've put my life into the rest 1%.

227. I grow faster compared to everyone else around me & I'm damn sure these aren't my hormones, these are my fucking testosterones.

228. Cause she's the goddess I've been craving for all my life.

229.
