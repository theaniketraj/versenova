Once upon a time 


I was standing on a shore 


Trying to recall 


The night before 


For I was dizzy


And my life upside down 


Sea waves infront of me 


Telling me something 


Which I couldn't hold


Melancholy thoughts in my mind 


Searching for what's left behind 


After all, sadness was all that I had


All my hardwork, innocence which never got paid


Always confused between two notions 


I love sadness or sadness loves me


Something must be reason it never cease me 


For I always thought 


Loneliness is beautiful 


Ofcourse it is, but not more than 


Being buried in one self
