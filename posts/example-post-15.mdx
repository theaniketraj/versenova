Look what you made me to do


Look where you got me stalling


I never thought the way I do now


My mind so blank


Only fills with your thoughts


Thinking about you and your guy


Wondering what you two share


Talks same as me Or you have


An alternate reality just for him


I can't just stop Wondering


The kinds of reels you two share


Deeper than I dig to send you or


Much more funnier than I do


If you are never meant to be


With me upto all the end


I want this chapter of my life


To end as quick as soon


What's the point of being


Together if it's destined to


Be separated at one point


I wish to ignore you


But However I try


I find myself Rolling back to you


As if you are the air I need to survive


Or a thought I think while my eyes blink


You said you have no problem


Keeping up with guy all equal


But that did break me in half
