I've seen you 


Burning like hell 


Looks like you're hiding 


Something for so long 


Baby trust me 


I wanna know that 


And it's time to tell 


I'll always be there for you 


Your secrets or fantasies 


Treat them as mine and 


Won't stop until I achieve 


So, tell me everything 


That burn you on inside 


Even if it's mean 


I've seen a hurricane of pain 


Inside your heart 


Which aches while you hide 


You're getting better at hiding pain 


But trust me it won't last long 


Cause I'm getting better at


Reading your mind as days pass by 


Remember when we met the promise we made


We'll love each other even if it's like sitting on thorn 


You've maybe forgot that 


I'm here to remind you again 


So, tell me my baby 


What's inside your mind 


Which makes your hand tremble


While we make love when the world sleeps
