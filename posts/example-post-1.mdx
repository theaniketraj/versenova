## A brief history of my poetic inclination beginnings with some excerpts.

It all started on a regular summer day when I was in **8th grade**. Five of usâ€”deeply immersed in Bollywood movies and endless cinema discussionsâ€”decided to write a song together. Each of us contributed, and by the end, we had something that felt truly ours. But then, we lost the diary. Just like that, our song was gone.

Life moved on, and for a while, writing didnâ€™t cross my mind. But one evening, I felt an urge to write something on my own. No collaborations, no shared effortsâ€”just me and my thoughts. I penned down my first piece that night, and since then, the journey has never stopped.

I write whenever I find the time. Sometimes, poetry strikes when I least expect itâ€”when my thoughts are nowhere near it. And yet, in these spontaneous moments, I realize something: **I have found it.**

It has been **nine years** since that first piece. For the first **seven years**, my writing remained confined to **English**. But in **2023**, I challenged myself to explore Hindi poetry. Iâ€™ve tried, but I know there's still a long way to go before I truly master the languageâ€™s poetic depth.

Oh, and then thereâ€™s **Urdu poetry**â€”a world I fell in love with. Every now and then, I attempt to write in Urdu, but I fail miserably. Maybe one day, Iâ€™ll get it right. For now, I remain optimistic about my poetry journey.

I think a lot. Just keep **thinking about everything. In a loop.** So why not, **give the loop a space**, here we go, but I'll write my thoughts in **raw format just the way I think**, unedited. (as if I'm explaining it to someone, if that makes it clear).

Except for the **VerseNova Guidelines** page, all my writings follow a **concise and universally accessible** style, ensuring clarity for readers across all age groups.

My writings are never static; they are in constant evolution. I frequently **revisit, inspect, and refine** them. Thereâ€™s always something to improve, something to sharpen.<sup>1</sup>

Now that Iâ€™ve decided to share my poetry publicly, it's important to establish a **common understanding** of what VerseNova stands for to help **protect my work**, ensure **proper credit**, and **maintain the integrity** of VerseNova.
